# Data Normalization Project

## Parser

This project is a web-based data parser that allows users to upload CSV, Text, JSON, or Excel files and transform them into a clean, normalized format. Uploaded data can be mapped to consistent fields (such as Date, Description, and Amount) and displayed side-by-side as both original and normalized tables.

The goal of this project is to tackle one of the most common problems in finance and analytics: inconsistent file formats. By creating a flexible file uploader and column-mapping interface, I’ve learned how to handle different parsing strategies, normalization workflows, and data validation in React and TypeScript/Python.

While the project is still under development and will continue to improve, it already demonstrates:

File type detection and parsing for multiple formats.

A column mapping UI that lets users align arbitrary headers with a unified schema.

A normalization step that outputs clean transaction data for downstream use.

A foundation for future dashboards, persistence, and backend integration.

This project is part of my portfolio because it reflects the core of my learning journey—not just “coding for the sake of coding,” but understanding how data flows, how to structure normalization logic, and how to prepare for scalable features such as dashboards, Excel integration, and database persistence.

There will be upcoming dashboard web.
This below will be the upcoming overall personal/company dashboard with import Master_Template feature that have data whole stored in the dashboard
